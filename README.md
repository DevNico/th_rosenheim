## Installation

Since this is an unofficial App it unfortunately cannot be released in the App Store or Google Play.

### Android

To use this Application on Android phones you can download the latest prebuilt apk.

[Releases](https://github.com/DevNico/th_rosenheim/releases/)

### IOS / Build from source

#### Introduction

Ios does not have an easy to use version of the Android apk therefore you will have to build the app from source. To do this you need a Mac or someone who has one since building IOS Apps is only possible under MacOS as of right now. For Android Windows and Linux are also fine.


#### Setup

First you have to follow the steps listed on flutter.dev [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/) to setup Flutter on your System.

Now you can clone the repo with

`$ git clone https://github.com/devnico/th_rosenheim.git`

Now go into the new directory with

`$ cd th_rosenheim`

and get the required packages with

`$ flutter pub get`

#### Building and installing

Make sure your phone is connected and ready. For Android USB Debugging has to be enabled.

For IOS run

`$ flutter build ios --release && flutter install ios`

For Android run

`$ flutter build apk --release && flutter install apk`
